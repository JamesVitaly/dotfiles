## .files
Fresh starts made easier. My personal .files.

- Run `git clone https://github.com/sgoudie/dotfiles.git` in `~`
- Run `source setup.sh`
- Make some coffee ☕️
- Done.

You'll need to add:
- SSH keys
- Do some atom stuff (like snippets)
- Install some fonts
- You might need to manually copy the link to aliases for ZSHRC
